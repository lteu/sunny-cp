# SUNNY-CP 2.2

SUNNY-CP: a Parallel CP Portfolio Solver

sunny-cp [5] is a parallel parallel portfolio solver that allows to solve a
Constraint (Satisfaction/Optimization) Problem defined in the MiniZinc language.
It essentially implements the SUNNY algorithm described in [1][2][3] and extends
its sequential version [4] that attended the MiniZinc Challenge 2014 [6].
sunny-cp is built on top of state-of-the-art constraint solvers, including:
Choco, Chuffed, HaifaCSP,
JaCoP, MinisatID, OR-Tools, Picat. These solvers are 
not included by default in sunny-cp, except for those already included in the 
MiniZinc bundle (i.e., Chuffed and Gecode).
However, sunny-cp provides utilities for adding new solvers to the portfolio and
for customizing their settings. Moreover, sunny-cp enables to use more solvers 
via Docker (see below).

In a nutshell, sunny-cp relies on two sequential steps:

  1. PRE-SOLVING: consists in the parallel execution of a (maybe empty) static
     schedule and the neighborhood computation of underlying k-NN algorithm;

  2. SOLVING: consists in the parallel and cooperative execution of a number of
     the predicted solvers, selected by means of SUNNY algorithm.

sunny-cp won the gold medal in the open track of MiniZinc Challenges 2015, 2016,
and 2017 [6].

## Installation & Usage by HTTP POST requests 

To install sunny-cp it is possible to use [Docker](https://www.docker.com) available for
the majority of the operating systems. It can then be used by simply sending a 
post request to the server deployed by using docker (for a local installation of
sunny-cp please see the Manual Installation section below). 

The Docker image is availabe in Docker Hub. To install it please run the
following commands.
```
sudo docker pull jacopomauro/sunny-cp
sudo docker run -d -p <PORT>:9001 --name sunny_cp_container jacopomauro/sunny-cp
```
where `<PORT>` is the port used to use the functionalities of the service.

Assuming that `<MZN>` is the path of the mzn file to solve,
to run the solver on it is possible to invoke it by a multipart post request as follows.
```
curl -F "mzn=@<MZN>" http://localhost:<PORT>/process
```
This will run sunny-cp with the default parameters on the minizinc instance.
If a `<DZN>` file is also needed, sunny-cp can be invoked as follows.
```
curl -F "mzn=@<MZN>" -F "dzn=@<DZN>" http://localhost:<PORT>/process
```
sunny-cp options can be passed by adding the string "option=value" as additional
part of the request.

For instance to solve the `<MZN>` using only the gecode solver (option `-P`)
the post request to perform is the following one.
```
curl -F "-P=gecode" -F "mzn=@<MZN>" http://localhost:<PORT>/process
```
To see the options supported by sunny-cp please run the following command.
```
curl -F "--help=" http://localhost:<PORT>/process
```
To select sunny-cp flags (like `--help` above) it is possible to add the string
"flag=". For example, the option `--mzn` is set with -F "--mzn=".
 
Note that the post requests will return the output generate by sunny-cp at the
end of its execution. In case partial solutions are need, it is possible 
to interact with sunny-cp from command line as specified in the remaining part of 
the section.

To understand what are the solvers installed you can use the following get request.
```
curl http://localhost:<PORT>/solvers
```

It is also possible to get the feature vector of an instance by using the following
post request.
```
curl -F "mzn=@<MZN>" -F "dzn=@<DZN>" http://localhost:<PORT>/get_features
```

To clean up please launch the following commands:
```
sudo docker stop sunny_cp_container
sudo docker rm sunny_cp_container
sudo docker rmi jacopomauro/sunny-cp
```
 
#### Interacting with SUNNY-CP from command line
 
To interact with SUNNY-CP, it is possible to run the docker container getting
a direct access to the bash. This can be done by running the following command.
```
sudo docker run --entrypoint="/bin/bash" -i --rm -t jacopomauro/sunny-cp
```
This will give access to the bash and SUNNY-CP can be invoked by running the
`sunny-cp` command like a manual installation.
To move the mzn and dzn files within the container
the `scp` command can be used or, alternatively, it is possible also to 
start the container with some shared volume (see
[Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/admin/volumes/volumes/)
for more information.)

## Manual Installation

sunny-cp is tested on 64-bit machines running Ubuntu 12.04, and not yet fully 
portable on other platforms. If you want to avoid the virtualization via Docker, 
you can manually install sunny-cp on Linux operating systems. 
Some of the main requirements for its installation are:

+ [Python](https://www.python.org/) (version >= 2)
+ [MiniZinc](http://www.minizinc.org/) (version >= 2.1.7)
+ [mzn2feat](https://github.com/CP-Unibo/mzn2feat) (version >= 1.2.1)
+ [psutil](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/psutil) (version >= 2)
+ [click](http://click.pocoo.org/) (version >= 6)

To manually install sunny-cp, simply run the `install.sh` script in the main 
directory:
```
  sunny-cp$ ./install.sh
```
This is a minimal installation script that checks the prerequisites, compiles 
all the python sources of sunny-cp and builds the portfolio of sunny-cp (e.g., 
it creates file SUNNY_HOME/src/pfolio_solvers.py).

If the installation is successful, you will see the following message:
```
  --- Everything went well!
  To complete sunny-cp installation you just have to add/modify the
  environment variables SUNNY_HOME and PATH:
  1. SUNNY_HOME must point to: "$PWD"/sunny-cp
  2. PATH must be extended to include: "$PWD"/bin
```

It is important to set such variables in order to use sunny-cp. Once the 
variables are set, check the installation by typing the command: 
```
  sunny-cp --help
```
for printing the help page.

Note that installing SUNNY-CP is recommended only for expert linux users.
More detail information of the commands and the additional requirents to install
SUNNY-CP and its solvers can be found in the Dockerfile in the docker folder.

## Solvers

By default, sunny-cp uses the solvers contained in the MiniZinc bundle, that is:
* [Gecode](http://www.gecode.org/)
* [Chuffed](https://github.com/geoffchu/chuffed)
* [OSICBS](http://www.minizinc.org/doc-2.2.1/en/modelling2.html)

It is however possible to use, via Docker, the following solvers:
* [OR-Tools](https://code.google.com/p/or-tools/) (version v6.9.1)
* [Choco](http://choco-solver.org/) (version 4.0.4)
* [Picat](http://picat-lang.org/) SAT (version 2.3)
* [JaCoP](http://jacop.osolpro.com/) (version 4.4)
* [MinisatID](http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/krr/software/minisatid) (version 3.11.0)
* [HaifaCSP](https://strichman.net.technion.ac.il/haifacsp/) (version 1.3.0)
* [Yuck](https://github.com/informarte/yuck) (version 20180303)

Once a solver is installed on your machine, it is easy to add it to 
the portfolio and to customize its settings. For more details, see the README 
file in the SUNNY_HOME/solvers folder and the sunny-cp usage.

Note that sunny-cp does not guarantee that its constituent solvers are bug free.
However, the user can check the soundness of a solution with the command line 
option `--check-solvers`.
In particular we recommend the usage of this option for haifacsp and minisatid
(they current versions are indeed bugged).

## Features

During the presolving phase (in parallel with the static schedule execution) 
sunny-cp extracts a feature vector of the problem in order to compute the 
solvers schedule possibly run in the solving phase. By default, the feature 
vector is extracted by mzn2feat tool available at
[https://github.com/CP-Unibo/mzn2feat](https://github.com/CP-Unibo/mzn2feat).

When using docker this tool is already installed in the image. In case of local
installation it needs otherwise to be installed manually following the 
instruction in the README file of mzn2feat.

Note that the user can define its 
own extractor by implementing a corresponding class in src/features.py

## Knowledge Base

The SUNNY algorithm on which sunny-cp relies needs a knowledge base, that
consists of a folder containing the information relevant for the schedule
computation. For the time being the default knowlege base of SUNNY-CP is empty.
However, the user has the possibility of defining its own knowledge bases.

The sunny-cp/kb/mznc1215 folder contains a knowledge base consisting of 76 CSP 
instances and 318 COP instances coming from the MiniZinc challenges 2012--2015.
Moreover, the knowledge base mznc15 used in the MiniZinc Challenges 2016--2017 
is also available. For more details, see the README file in sunny-cp/kb folder.

## Testing

Although a full support for automatic testing is not yet implemented, in the
sunny-cp/test/examples folder there is a number of simple MiniZinc models.
The user can test all the models by running the following command:
```
 test/examples$ ./run_examples
```
The run_examples script also produces output.log and errors.log files in the
test/examples folder, where the standard output/error of the tested models are
respectively redirected.

## Additional info

Previous versions of SUNNY-CP supported solvers that are currently not included
in the docker image due to compilation problems
or the fact that are not publicly available/free. The old solvers that are not provided
with the current default configuration are:
* [Mistral](http://homepages.laas.fr/ehebrard/mistral.html) (version does not print any output)
* [G12/Gurobi](http://www.gurobi.com/) (not free)
* [iZplus](http://www.constraint.org/ja/izc_download.html) (not publicly available)
* [Opturion](http://www.opturion.com) (not free)

We invite the developers interested in adding their solver
to the default image of sunny-cp to contact us.
